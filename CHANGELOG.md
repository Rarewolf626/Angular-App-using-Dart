## 2.0.0-beta.18

This is the first release of Angular 2 for Dart that is written directly in
Dart, instead of generated from TypeScript.


### API changes

The `Provider` constructor and `provide()` function are now more intuitive
when they have a single argument.

Before, `const Provider(Foo)` or `provide(Foo)`
would provide a `null` object.
To provide a `Foo` object, you had to use `const Provider(Foo, useClass:Foo)`
or `provide(Foo, useClass:Foo)`.
Now you can omit the `useClass:Foo`.
Either of the following provides a `Foo` instance:

```dart
const Provider(Foo)
// or
provide(Foo)
```

If you want the old behavior, change your code to specify `useValue`:

```dart
const Provider(Foo, useValue: null)
// or
provide(Foo, useValue: null)
```

### Known issues

* Some types of **dependency injection** don't work.

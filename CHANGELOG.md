<!-- ### Breaking changes -->

### API changes

* The `Provider` constructor and `provide()` function are now more intuitive
  when they have a single argument.

  Before, `const Provider(Foo)` or `provide(Foo)`
  would provide a `null` object.
  To provide a `Foo` object, you had to use `const Provider(Foo, useClass:Foo)`
  or `provide(Foo, useClass:Foo)`.
  Now you can omit the `useClass:Foo`.
  Either of the following provides a `Foo` instance:

  ```
const Provider(Foo)
// or
provide(Foo)
```

  If you want the old behavior, change your code to specify `useValue`:

   ```
const Provider(Foo, useValue: null)
// or
provide(Foo, useValue: null)
```

### Known issues

* Some types of **dependency injection** don't work.
